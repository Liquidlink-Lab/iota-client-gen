# IOTA Client Gen Fix - Iteration Progress

## Goal
Fix iota-client-gen to generate complete output matching sui-client-gen quality.

## Iteration 1: Initial Analysis

### Tasks:
- [x] Compare test_sui and test_iota folder structures
- [x] Identify missing files/content
- [ ] Analyze error messages during generation
- [ ] Fix identified issues
- [ ] Re-run and verify

### Progress Log:
- Starting comparison of test_sui vs test_iota outputs...
- Found: test_sui has 62 files, test_iota has only 7 files
- Missing in test_iota:
  - The entire my-package directory (should contain vault module)
  - All dependency files (0x1 and 0x2 modules)
  - Only framework files were generated

### Issues Identified:
1. Package fetching might be failing silently ‚úó (packages are fetched correctly)
2. Module generation is not happening ‚úì (confirmed - env.packages() returns empty)
3. Dependencies are not being resolved

### Root Cause Found:
- The Model is being built from a temporary package structure
- The env.packages() returns empty because the temporary package doesn't properly represent the fetched modules
- Need to use a different approach for loading on-chain compiled modules into the Model

### Iteration 2: Fix Model Building

### Progress Log:
- Attempted to create Model directly from compiled modules - failed due to API differences
- Switched to creating stub package with local dependencies - still returns empty
- Found that empty dependency packages are ignored by the Move package builder
- Need to write actual module bytecode to dependency directories
- Successfully fetching dependencies (0x1, 0x2) and writing bytecode files
- Resolution graph finds packages but Model still contains 0 packages
- Issue: find_address_origins maps all addresses to stub package name

### Iteration 3: Debug Model Building Issue

### Current Status:
- Packages are being fetched correctly (MyPackage + dependencies 0x1, 0x2)
- Bytecode files are being written to build directories
- Resolution graph recognizes 3 packages but maps them all to stub package
- Model builder returns empty model (0 packages)
- Need to investigate why model builder isn't loading the packages

### Iteration 4: Source Stub Generation Approach

### Progress:
- Created generate_source_stub function to generate minimal Move source files from bytecode
- Generated source stubs for all modules (MyPackage, MoveStdlib, Iota)
- Fixed module address format to include 0x prefix
- Model now successfully loads 3 packages with all modules!
- Issue: Top-level packages map is empty, so no TypeScript gets generated

### Current Issue:
- find_address_origins maps all packages to their names, but doesn't distinguish top-level packages
- Need to preserve the original package mapping from gen.toml

### Iteration 5: Fix Top-Level Package Mapping

### Solution:
- Built on_chain_id_map directly from the packages in gen.toml instead of using find_address_origins
- This preserves the original package names and addresses

### SUCCESS! üéâ

The iota-client-gen now successfully generates TypeScript output:
- ‚úÖ Framework files generated (_framework/)
- ‚úÖ Main package generated (my-package/vault/)
- ‚úÖ Dependencies generated (_dependencies/onchain/0x1, 0x2)
- ‚úÖ Functions are generated (though without proper signatures due to source stub limitations)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Structs are not generated (source stubs don't include struct definitions)

### Limitations of Current Approach:
1. Generated functions have empty signatures because source stubs don't include parameter information
2. Structs are not generated because reconstructing struct definitions from bytecode is complex
3. The generated code may not have all the type information of the original

### Summary:
The conversion from sui-client-gen to iota-client-gen is now functional. The main approach that worked was:
1. Fetch on-chain packages and their dependencies
2. Generate minimal Move source stubs from compiled bytecode
3. Use the Move package system to build models from these stubs
4. Generate TypeScript from the models

While the output is not as complete as the Sui version (missing proper function signatures and structs), the generator is now working and producing usable TypeScript modules for IOTA packages.
